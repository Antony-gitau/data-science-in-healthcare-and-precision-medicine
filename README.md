![Certificate](Images/certificate.png)


These are the series of projects and assignments I did while taking the course (*[Data Science in Stratified Healthcare and Stratified Healthcare](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datascimed)*)

# Week one : Introduction to programming in python

Topics covered included:
+ Basic data structures
Working with tuples, lists, dictionaries.
+ working with pandas library:
 series and dataframes.
+ Reading csv with pandas, working with the data and visualizing it. 


# Week two : Sequence Processing and Medical Image Analysis

This involved working on DICOM format data storing MRI images.

Using; 
+ pydicom python package for working with DICOM files.
+ SimpleITK an image processing library. Useful in segmentation development and imgae registration program.
+ visualizing  MRI images using matplotlib
+ manipulating the data: doing segmentation, smoothing, hole-filling, and working with white and gray matter.



# Week three : Probabilistic, Network Modelling and an introduced to Machine Learning in Biomedicine
This involved a discussion on network representation, examples of biological networks.
Key statistical methods for analysing medical data and basic machine learning techniques to medical data.

# Week four : Natural Language Techniques

This involved a discussion and application natural language processing techniques on clinical data.
Interpreting basic process models in healthcare and a different technique for analysing processes.


# Week five : Graph Data model and explore societal, legal and ethical implications of precision medicine and stratified healthcare

This week involved a discussion on graph data modelling, key ontologies in medicine and general data protection regulation. 
This was followed up be a legal, ethical, and societal implication of precision medicine and stratified healthcare.
